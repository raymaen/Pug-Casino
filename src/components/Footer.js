            Charles Fey was credited with the invention of the first slot
            machine in 1895.
            <br />
            He was a San Franciscan mechanic who worked for a company and later
            started his own company. The first slot machine was not played in a
            casino.
            <br /> <br />
            Feyâ€™s Liberty Bell machine was placed at his auto shop where his
            customers could enjoy themselves while waiting for their vehicles to
            be repaired.
            <br />
            Seeing the popularity of the slot machines, many casinos introduced
            these machines in their casinos so that their gamblers could play
            when table games would be occupied.
